# PyBites challenges

In this repo I will collect all the challenges I made from PyBites.

The setup is as follows:

1. download de code for the challenge to your computer 
1. unpack the code
1. make a folder for the challenge you unpacked   
1. copy the starterfile and test to the project folder
1. start working on the challenge and when you pass all the tests push your code back to GitHub with the commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "submission Bite 15 @ codechalleng.es"
git push
```
